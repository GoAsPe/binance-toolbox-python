# Binance Toolbox - Margin

## Preparation
Some api endpoints requires sending a valid API-Key and signature, so in order for some scripts to work, please set up 
your account's api key pair as environment variables.

```shell
export BINANCE_API_KEY=<your_api_key>
export BINANCE_API_SECRET=<your_secret_key>
```

## Scripts
Each script file contains its purpose and instructions information. Current available scripts:

- get_my_trades.py
